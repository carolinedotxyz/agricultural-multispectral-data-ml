# Agricultural ML Showcase

A demonstration of **multi-spectral agricultural data preparation, validation, and analysis** designed to support machine learning workflows.  
This repository focuses on **data handling, quality assurance, and exploratory analysis**, providing high-quality inputs for downstream agricultural ML applications.

---

## Project Overview

This showcase demonstrates skills in:

- **Multi-spectral data processing** (RGB + NDVI imagery)  
- **Agricultural data validation and quality assurance**  
- **Cloud coverage analysis** (with future extensions to full cloud masking and atmospheric correction)  
- **Structured data workflows** for crop-level preparation and comparison  
- **Clean, maintainable code** following industry best practices  

**Note:** The repository includes pre-processed RGB + NDVI data (97%+ cloud-free), ready for immediate analysis and ML preparation.
